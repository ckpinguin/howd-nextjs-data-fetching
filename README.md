# Hands-on Web Dev Next.js Data Fetching

This code supports the "Next.js Data Fetching" series from the [Hands-on Web Dev newsletter](https://newsletter.howd.dev).

To try the first workshop in this series, [start here](https://newsletter.howd.dev/challenges/023/)!

## Related series

This series builds on the [React Components](https://newsletter.howd.dev/challenges/017/) series. If you haven't looked at that series, you might want to start there instead.

The work from this series will be used in the following series: [AI Style Generator](https://newsletter.howd.dev/challenges/029/), where you will use the [OpenAI Node SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) to generate styles for the quote fetched in this series.

2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` from a web browser
